Each project's documentation is hosted on its own site and the version shown there is built from `main` (development documentation) until that project has a release; a release documentation version exists only after the first release is tagged. Every project's documentation can also be built from its repository with `make docs` (see {doc}`development/building-docs`). The planned releases are unreleased targets, recorded in each project's `compatibility.json`.
