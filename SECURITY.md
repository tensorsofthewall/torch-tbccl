# Security policy

## Supported versions

torch-tbccl has not been released yet; 0.2.0 is the first planned release. Once releases exist, security fixes are made against the latest release series only. Development versions and unreleased branches are not supported.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue for a suspected vulnerability.

Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting: open the repository's Security tab and choose "Report a vulnerability". If that option is not available, open an issue that says only that you have a security report and asks for a private channel; do not put details in it.

## What to include

- The affected version or commit and the platform.
- What you observed and what you expected.
- The smallest reproduction you can give: code, input bytes or steps.
- Whether you believe it is exploitable, and under which deployment assumptions.
- Whether and how you want to be credited.

Please do not include credentials, private keys or details of a private network.

## What to expect

This is a volunteer-maintained project. Reports are acknowledged on a best-effort basis, normally within a few days. A confirmed issue is fixed on the main branch first and released in the next release of the supported series; the advisory credits the reporter unless they ask otherwise. Please allow a reasonable time to fix a confirmed issue before you disclose it publicly.

## Scope

This policy covers the PyTorch backend and its compiled extension, which statically links libtbccl. Memory-safety or crash bugs in the compiled extension are in scope. Behavior inherited from libtbccl or from torch.distributed (for example the unauthenticated TCPStore rendezvous, or TBCCL's lack of authentication and encryption) is documented and is reported upstream to that project's policy where it applies.

The supported deployment assumptions are described in the security model in the documentation: TBCCL assumes trusted peers on a trusted network.
